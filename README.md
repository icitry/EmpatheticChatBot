Iâ€™m sure we all have at least one friend we can consider a living Database of Memes, ready for whatever life, or you, may throw at them. Quite the fascinating beings they are, and certainly worth studying, and if lucky, maybe even replicate, to a certain degree. 

And what better way to replicate them if not by using Machine Learning techniques to rival AI giants like ChatGPT, Bing Copilot or Google Bard (even Grok, if you care about that). 

Enjoy my attempt at creating a full stack Empathetic Chat Bot app that will make it seem as if you're talking to a real human (debatable) behind the screen.
